			<h1> About Us</h1>
			<p> Welcome! BeyondBlue STUDENT is a hub for Australian adolscents that allows them to connect with like minded people to grow, learn and introduce them into the wonders of charity and volunteering. Why do we do what we do? In Australia, it's estimated that around 45% of people will experience a mental health condition in their lifetime. Every year 1 million Australians have depression, and over 2 million suffer from anxiety. A large majority of this number are our youth, who of which are the most vulnerable as they unlikely lack the mental maturity to be able to cop with it. Depression in our youth is on the rise. The global rate of diagnosed depression in adolescents are rising rapidly, increasing 63% in the last 7 years</p>
			<p> Beyond Blue Student dedicates its efforts into not only bringing awareness to this very real issue within our adolescent community but also to raise money, volunteer and give them resources. Together we can understand mental health and ultimately give our youth the resources to cope and grow into amazing human beings </p>
